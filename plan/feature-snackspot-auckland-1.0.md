# Introduction

This implementation plan provides a step-by-step, machine-readable roadmap for building the SnackSpot Auckland application as defined in the design specification. The plan is structured for autonomous execution by AI agents or humans, with explicit, deterministic tasks and validation criteria.

## 1. Requirements & Constraints

- **REQ-001**: Use React with TypeScript for frontend, C# with .NET 8+ and EF Core for backend.
- **REQ-002**: Implement responsive, accessible UI (WCAG 2.1 AA, Lighthouse ≥ 90).
- **REQ-003**: Support CRUD for core entities (users, snacks, reviews, categories).
- **REQ-004**: Use Git with meaningful commit history and pre-commit hooks.
- **REQ-005**: Deploy both frontend and backend to public endpoints with monitoring and rollback.
- **SEC-001**: JWT authentication with secure refresh, input validation, rate limiting, GDPR/NZ Privacy Act compliance.
- **CON-001**: All public API endpoints must be versioned (e.g., /api/v1/).
- **GUD-001**: Use Azure Well-Architected Framework pillars.
- **PAT-001**: Use Instagram-style sharing cards for social features.

## 2. Implementation Steps

### Implementation Phase 1
- GOAL-001: Establish project structure, version control, and CI/CD pipelines.

| Task | Description | Completed | Date |
|------|-------------|-----------|------|
| TASK-001 | Initialize Git repository with .gitignore, README.md, and commit conventions. |  |  |
| TASK-002 | Set up monorepo or separate repos for frontend and backend in /src/frontend and /src/backend. |  |  |
| TASK-003 | Configure GitHub Actions for CI/CD for both frontend and backend. |  |  |
| TASK-004 | Add pre-commit hooks for linting and commit message checks. |  |  |

### Implementation Phase 2
- GOAL-002: Scaffold and implement backend API with C# .NET 8+, EF Core, and SQL database.

| Task | Description | Completed | Date |
|------|-------------|-----------|------|
| TASK-005 | Scaffold .NET 8+ Web API project in /src/backend. |  |  |
| TASK-006 | Set up EF Core, configure SQL database, and implement migrations. |  |  |
| TASK-007 | Define and implement core entities: User, Snack, Review, Category. |  |  |
| TASK-008 | Implement versioned API endpoints (/api/v1/...) for CRUD operations. |  |  |
| TASK-009 | Implement JWT authentication with refresh token logic and secure storage. |  |  |
| TASK-010 | Add input validation, rate limiting, and error handling middleware. |  |  |
| TASK-011 | Write unit and integration tests for API endpoints and business logic. |  |  |
| TASK-012 | Set up monitoring, health checks, and deployment pipeline for backend. |  |  |

### Implementation Phase 3
- GOAL-003: Scaffold and implement frontend with React, TypeScript, and accessibility best practices.

| Task | Description | Completed | Date |
|------|-------------|-----------|------|
| TASK-013 | Scaffold React + TypeScript project in /src/frontend. |  |  |
| TASK-014 | Set up Tailwind CSS (or chosen styling library) and configure breakpoints. |  |  |
| TASK-015 | Implement routing with React Router. |  |  |
| TASK-016 | Build core UI components: map view, snack cards, forms, navigation. |  |  |
| TASK-017 | Ensure all UI meets WCAG 2.1 AA and Lighthouse ≥ 90. |  |  |
| TASK-018 | Integrate frontend with backend API endpoints. |  |  |
| TASK-019 | Implement authentication flows and secure token storage. |  |  |
| TASK-020 | Write unit, integration, and E2E tests for UI and flows. |  |  |
| TASK-021 | Set up monitoring, health checks, and deployment pipeline for frontend. |  |  |

### Implementation Phase 4
- GOAL-004: Implement advanced features, gamification, and social sharing.

| Task | Description | Completed | Date |
|------|-------------|-----------|------|
| TASK-022 | Implement leveling, badges, and area unlocking logic. |  |  |
| TASK-023 | Add Instagram-style sharing card generation. |  |  |
| TASK-024 | Implement user-generated content moderation and reporting. |  |  |
| TASK-025 | Add accessibility enhancements and conduct a11y audit. |  |  |
| TASK-026 | Finalize documentation and onboarding flows. |  |  |

## 3. Alternatives

- **ALT-001**: Use JavaScript instead of TypeScript for frontend (rejected: less type safety).
- **ALT-002**: Use Node.js/Express for backend (rejected: does not meet .NET/EF Core requirement).

## 4. Dependencies

- **DEP-001**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS (or chosen styling library)
- **DEP-002**: .NET 8+, Entity Framework Core, SQL database
- **DEP-003**: GitHub Actions, pre-commit hooks
- **DEP-004**: Google Maps API, Cloudinary, AWS S3, Firebase Cloud Messaging

## 5. Files

- **FILE-001**: /src/frontend/ (React app source)
- **FILE-002**: /src/backend/ (C# .NET API source)
- **FILE-003**: /README.md (project documentation)
- **FILE-004**: /plan/feature-snackspot-auckland-1.0.md (this plan)
- **FILE-005**: /spec/spec-design-snackspot-auckland.md (design spec)

## 6. Testing

- **TEST-001**: Unit tests for all backend API endpoints and business logic
- **TEST-002**: Integration tests for backend (API + DB)
- **TEST-003**: Unit and integration tests for frontend components and flows
- **TEST-004**: End-to-end tests for user journeys (Cypress or Playwright)
- **TEST-005**: Accessibility (a11y) tests (axe, Lighthouse)
- **TEST-006**: Performance/load tests for map and API endpoints

## 7. Risks & Assumptions

- **RISK-001**: Integration issues between frontend and backend APIs
- **RISK-002**: Accessibility or performance targets not met on first attempt
- **ASSUMPTION-001**: All team members are familiar with React, .NET, and CI/CD pipelines
