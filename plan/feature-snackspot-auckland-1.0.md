# Introduction

This implementation plan provides a step-by-step, machine-readable roadmap for building the SnackSpot Auckland application as defined in the design specification. The plan is structured for autonomous execution by AI agents or humans, with explicit, deterministic tasks and validation criteria.

## 1. Requirements & Constraints

- **REQ-001**: Use React with TypeScript for frontend, C# with .NET 8+ and EF Core for backend.
- **REQ-002**: Implement responsive, accessible UI (WCAG 2.1 AA, Lighthouse ≥ 90).
- **REQ-003**: Support CRUD for core entities (users, snacks, reviews, categories).
- **REQ-004**: Use Git with meaningful commit history and pre-commit hooks.
- **REQ-005**: Deploy both frontend and backend to public endpoints with monitoring, health checks, and documented rollback.
- **SEC-001**: JWT authentication with secure refresh, input validation, rate limiting, GDPR/NZ Privacy Act compliance, and secure storage of refresh tokens (httpOnly cookies).
- **SEC-002**: Uploaded images must be virus-scanned and stored securely.
- **SEC-003**: All endpoints must enforce input validation and sanitization, with business logic enforced on backend.
- **SEC-004**: API endpoints for scraping and public endpoints must be rate-limited and implement abuse prevention.
- **SEC-005**: All user data handling must comply with GDPR and NZ Privacy Act.
- **SEC-006**: Enforce HTTPS and strict CORS policy for all endpoints.
- **SEC-007**: Implement logging best practices (PII redaction, secure log storage).
- **SEC-008**: Automated dependency vulnerability scanning in CI (Dependabot, dotnet audit, npm audit).
- **CON-001**: All public API endpoints must be versioned (e.g., /api/v1/).
- **CON-002**: Only users Level 2+ can create new categories; user following is available at Level 3+.
- **GUD-001**: Use Azure Well-Architected Framework pillars (Security, Operational Excellence, Performance Efficiency, Reliability, Cost Optimization).
- **GUD-002**: Use consistent naming conventions and resource abbreviations; all resources must be tagged for cost/governance.
- **GUD-003**: Provide onboarding and clear user flows for first-time users.
- **PAT-001**: Use Instagram-style sharing cards for social features.
- **OPS-001**: Use Infrastructure as Code (Bicep, AVM modules) for all Azure resources.
- **OPS-002**: Implement blue/green or canary deployment strategy.
- **OPS-003**: Set up automated database backups and restore validation.
- **OPS-004**: Plan and implement high availability and disaster recovery.
- **OPS-005**: Use secret management (Azure Key Vault, environment variables) for all sensitive config.
- **OPS-006**: Implement environment-specific configuration and secret management.
